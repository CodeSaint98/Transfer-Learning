# Transfer Learning for Image Classification

The following project illustrates how one can use transfer learning to create an image classification model that works on the browser. Transfer Learning combines a pre-trained model with one's own custom training samples so as to leverage the functionality without having to create everything from scratch.
For this project we're going to be using snaps from our webcam as our custom training samples and use a KNN classifier to segregate the images into three classes. The predicted class and accuracy will then be displayed in real-time with respect to each frame of the media stream.
In layman's terms, this project is similar to a pose classifier. Strike any pose you want in front of the webcam and click on the class you wish to assign it to. I recommend you take a couple of images for each class as more training samples result in better prediction.
